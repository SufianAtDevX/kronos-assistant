## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Kronos AI Assistant on your local development environment, with a focus on ease of use within Visual Studio Code.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

* **Node.js** (LTS version recommended): Includes npm (Node Package Manager).
    * Download from: https://nodejs.org/
    * Verify installation by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal.
* **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):** A powerful and popular code editor.
    * Download from: https://code.visualstudio.com/

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Create Your Project Folder:**
    On your computer, create a new, empty directory for your project (e.g., `KronosAI`).
    Open this newly created folder in Visual Studio Code (`File > Open Folder...` and select `KronosAI`).

2.  **Populate Project Files:**
    Inside your `KronosAI` folder, create the necessary subdirectories: `public` and `src`.
    Copy the content of the provided `public/index.html` into `KronosAI/public/index.html`.
    Copy the content of the provided `src/index.js` into `KronosAI/src/index.js`.
    Copy the content of the provided `src/App.js` into `KronosAI/src/App.js`.
    Copy the content of the provided `package.json` directly into the `KronosAI` root folder.
    Copy the content of the provided `main.js` directly into the `KronosAI` root folder.

3.  **Install Project Dependencies:**
    Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Terminal > New Terminal` or use the shortcut `Ctrl + ").
    Ensure your terminal's current directory is `KronosAI` (you should see `KronosAI>` in the terminal prompt).
    Run the following command to install all required project libraries and frameworks, including Electron:

    ```bash
npm install
    ```

    This command reads the dependencies and `devDependencies` from your `package.json` and installs them into a `node_modules` folder. This process might take a few minutes depending on your internet connection.

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the React Development Server (First):**
    In the VS Code terminal, execute:

    ```bash
npm start
    ```

    This will compile your React application and launch a local development server (typically at `http://localhost:3000`). Keep this terminal running.

2.  **Start the Electron Desktop Application (Second):**
    Open a new integrated terminal in VS Code (`Terminal > New Terminal`).
    In this new terminal, ensure you are in the `KronosAI` root directory.
    Execute the command:

    ```bash
npm run electron-start
    ```

    This will launch the Electron desktop window, which will load your React application from the development server.

    The development server features hot-reloading: any changes you make and save in your React source files (`.js`, `.jsx`) will automatically trigger a recompile and refresh in the browser and the Electron window, providing a highly efficient development workflow.

### Building for Production (Desktop Application)

To create a distributable desktop application for Windows (or other OS), you'll use `electron-builder`.

* **Install `electron-builder`:**

    ```bash
npm install electron-builder --save-dev
    ```

* **Build Command:** In your `package.json`, you'll add a build script (this is already included in the `package.json` provided below):

    ```json
"build-electron": "electron-builder"
    ```

* **Run Build:**

    ```bash
npm run build-electron
    ```

    This will create an executable installer for your application in the `dist` folder.

## Advanced Functionalities: How They Work (Roadmap Details)

Implementing the advanced AI-driven functionalities you envision requires a multi-layered approach, primarily involving a backend service to handle complex logic, secure API interactions, and AI model calls. The Electron frontend will act as the user's interface to this powerful backend.

### 1. AI-Driven Social Media Automation

This feature will allow the AI to create and manage content, and then post it to various social media platforms.

* **User Interaction (Frontend - Electron/React):**
    * The user provides a high-level prompt or topic for a social media post (e.g., "Generate a promotional post for our new web development service, targeting startups").
    * The user can specify platforms (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn), desired tone, and any key points to include.
    * The UI displays generated captions, suggested tags, and preview of promotional images.
    * User reviews and approves content before scheduling/posting.

* **Backend Service (Node.js/Python - The Brain):**
    * **API Endpoints:** The backend will expose secure API endpoints (e.g., `/api/social-media/generate-content`, `/api/social-media/post`).
    * **Authentication & Authorization:** Manages user authentication (e.g., Firebase, JWT) and ensures the user has permission to interact with social media accounts.
    * **Social Media Platform Integration:**
        * **OAuth 2.0:** Implements OAuth 2.0 flows for Instagram Graph API, Facebook Graph API, and LinkedIn Marketing API. This allows users to securely grant Kronos permission to post on their behalf without sharing their direct login credentials. Access tokens are securely stored in the backend.
        * **API Calls:** Uses the official SDKs or direct HTTP requests to interact with each platform's API for:
            * Retrieving user profile information.
            * Posting text, images, and videos.
            * Scheduling posts for future publication.
            * Retrieving post analytics (optional, for dashboard insights).
    * **Content Generation (AI Models):**
        * **Caption & Tag Generation (LLM - e.g., Gemini 2.0 Flash):**
            * When the frontend requests content, the backend sends the user's prompt (topic, tone, keywords) to the Gemini API.
            * **Prompt Engineering:** The backend constructs a sophisticated prompt for the LLM, guiding it to generate creative, engaging captions and relevant hashtags.
            * The LLM's response (caption, tags) is sent back to the frontend for user review.
        * **Promotional Post Rendering (Image Generation - e.g., Imagen 3.0):**
            * If the user requests a promotional image, the backend sends a text prompt (e.g., "A futuristic image of a website being built with glowing lines, for a web development service") to the Imagen API.
            * **Image Manipulation (Optional):** The backend can use image processing libraries (e.g., `sharp` in Node.js, `Pillow` in Python) to:
                * Overlay the generated caption text onto the image.
                * Add the Dev X House logo.
                * Apply filters or stylistic effects.
            * The final image is sent back to the frontend for preview.
    * **Scheduling & Posting Logic:** Manages a queue of posts, ensuring they are sent to the correct platforms at the scheduled times.
    * **Data Flow:**
        * **Frontend (Electron/React):** User inputs prompt -> Sends request to Backend API.
        * **Backend Service:** Receives request -> Calls Gemini API for text -> Calls Imagen API for image (if needed) -> Processes/manipulates image -> Stores generated content/schedule in a database (e.g., Firestore).
        * **Backend Service:** Sends generated content (caption, tags, image URL) back to Frontend.
        * **Frontend:** Displays content for user review/approval.
        * **Frontend:** User approves/schedules -> Sends confirmation to Backend.
        * **Backend Service:** At scheduled time, calls respective social media platform APIs (Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn) to post the content.

* **Key Considerations:**
    * **API Rate Limits:** Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms for social media APIs to manage rate limits.
    * **Platform Terms of Service:** Strictly adhere to each platform's terms of service regarding automated posting to prevent account suspension.
    * **Security:** Never expose API keys directly in the frontend. All sensitive operations must occur on the backend.
    * **User Consent:** Clearly inform users about the permissions Kronos requires to post on their behalf.

### 2. Intelligent Proposal Automation

This feature will enable the AI to automatically find suitable jobs and submit tailored proposals on freelancing platforms.

* **User Interaction (Frontend - Electron/React):**
    * The user integrates their Guru/Upwork profiles (likely through an OAuth flow managed by the backend).
    * The user defines their expertise, preferred job types, minimum rates, and any specific keywords.
    * The UI displays matching job listings, AI-generated proposals, and submission status.

* **Backend Service (Node.js/Python - The Brain):**
    * **API Endpoints:** Exposes endpoints for profile integration, job search, proposal generation, and submission.
    * **Freelancing Platform Integration:**
        * **API Access:** Research and integrate with Guru and Upwork APIs. (Crucial Note: Automated job application via public APIs is often heavily restricted or requires special partnerships due to platform policies against botting. This part of the functionality might require alternative approaches like browser automation tools if direct APIs are not available or suitable.)
        * **Profile Sync:** Securely fetches and stores the user's professional profile details (skills, experience, portfolio, past jobs) from these platforms.
    * **Job Matching (AI/ML):**
        * **Job Listing Fetching:** Periodically fetches new job listings from the integrated platforms.
        * **Data Parsing:** Parses raw job descriptions to extract key requirements, skills, budget, and project type.
        * **Matching Algorithm:**
            * Uses LLMs (like Gemini 2.0 Flash) to understand the semantic meaning of job descriptions and compare them against the user's profile.
            * Applies machine learning models (e.g., similarity algorithms, classification) to identify the "best jobs" based on:
                * Direct skill matches.
                * Experience relevance.
                * Budget alignment.
                * User-defined preferences (e.g., "only remote jobs," "minimum 5-star rating clients").
                * Success probability (based on past user data, if available).
    * **Proposal Generation (LLM - e.g., Gemini 2.0 Flash):**
        * Once a "best job" is identified, the backend sends the job description and the user's relevant profile details to the Gemini API.
        * **Advanced Prompt Engineering:** The backend crafts a highly sophisticated prompt for the LLM, instructing it to:
            * Generate a personalized proposal in "proper academic human writing" style.
            * Address specific points from the job description.
            * Highlight the user's most relevant skills and experiences for that specific job.
            * Include a compelling call to action.
            * Maintain a professional and persuasive tone.
            * Dynamically insert placeholders for client name, project details, and custom opening/closing statements.
        * The generated proposal is sent back to the frontend for user review.
    * **Automated Submission:** If platform APIs allow and user approval is given, the backend submits the AI-generated proposal.
    * **Human-in-the-Loop:** For critical applications like this, it's highly recommended to have a "human-in-the-loop" step where the user must review and approve each AI-generated proposal before it is automatically submitted. This mitigates risks of irrelevant or poorly written proposals and ensures compliance.
    * **Data Flow:**
        * **Frontend (Electron/React):** User integrates profile -> Sends profile data/authorization to Backend.
        * **Backend Service:** Securely stores profile credentials/tokens -> Periodically fetches new job listings from platforms.
        * **Backend Service:** Processes job listings with AI/ML to find matches -> Generates proposals using Gemini API.
        * **Backend Service:** Sends matched jobs and generated proposals to Frontend.
        * **Frontend:** Displays job matches and proposals for user review.
        * **Frontend:** User approves a proposal -> Sends submission request to Backend.
        * **Backend Service:** Submits the proposal to the target platform via API (if allowed).

* **Key Considerations:**
    * **Platform Terms of Service (CRITICAL):** Automated proposal submission can violate the terms of service of freelancing platforms. This is the most significant challenge and risk. Thoroughly review Guru and Upwork's policies on automation. Many platforms explicitly forbid automated applications to maintain a fair and human-centric marketplace.
    * **API Availability:** Public APIs for automated job application might be limited or non-existent. Alternative solutions like controlled browser automation (e.g., using Puppeteer or Selenium in the backend) might be considered, but these are more fragile and still subject to ToS.
    * **Quality Control:** The "academic human writing" quality depends heavily on prompt engineering and the LLM's capabilities. Continuous monitoring and refinement will be necessary.
    * **Error Handling & Notifications:** Implement robust error handling for API failures and notify the user if a proposal submission fails.
    * **Ethical AI:** Ensure the AI is used responsibly and transparently, and that users understand its capabilities and limitations.

This roadmap provides a detailed architectural vision for implementing these advanced features. Each point represents a significant development effort, particularly the backend services and AI integrations.
